  description:
    The solution aimed to simplify diagnostic workflow by pruning the number of assessments performed in the general internal medicine ward. 
    We use past known lab test results to predict whether the patient deteriorated or was discharged.
    As a result, we could decrease the amount of additional tests by an average of 3% while retaining the same outcome.<br>
